bond_statistics_atom_groups: |
  <p>Define atom groups by enclosing a list of one or more atom numbers in
  parentheses. The computed property at each time step is determined by the
  number of atom groups:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>2 groups: bond length (in angstrom)</li>
    <li>3 groups: angle (in degrees)</li>
    <li>4 groups: dihedral angle (in degrees)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>E.g., the group list "(1,2,3)(4,5,6)" corresponds to the length
  between the centroids of the first group (1,2,3) and the second group
  (4,5,6).</p>
  <p>To compute multiple properties, use an index file.</p>

  <p>Example index file contents:</p>

  <p>Groups are defined in the INDEX section and may consist of any number

  <p>Group position at any time step is the selected atoms' centroid.</p>
